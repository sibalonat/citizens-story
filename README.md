# This Respository is Build with the Small City Big Stories in Saleza

> The source Code is forked and adapted to the new Infografik Journalism Project developed by Brander and CC in coperation with the US embassy in Tirana. This forked site focuses on stories of people that share stories about the limitation of Human Rights improvements that certain communities face when it comes to accesibility, rule of law, and quality of life in public spaces.

We do this by making a small interactive documentary of each of these communities and the challenges to better improve the quality of life in their day-to-day activities in the cities where they live.
